Daraus ist ein Konzept zu entwickeln wie das Softwaresystem grundsätzlich diese Aufgaben zu bewältigen hat, um dann die einzelnen Funktionen und Qualitätseigenschaften im Detail festzulegen. Für die vielfältigen, unterschiedlichen Aufgaben eines Softwaresystems gibt es eine Reihe spezifischer Methoden und Vorgehensweisen, die dabei helfen, die einzelnen Aufgaben effektiv zu erfassen und zu beschreiben. Insbesondere sind erfasste Anforderungen zusammen mit den Stakeholdern sorgfältig zu analysieren, zu hinterfragen und zu validieren, um sicher zu sein, dass die erfassten Anforderungen auch die tatsächlichen Bedürfnisse widerspiegeln und diese in angemessener Form beschreiben. Dieses Kapitel führt ausgewählte Techniken und Methoden der Anforderungsanalyse ein. Ein allgemeiner Prozess zur Anforderungserhebung bildet dafür den Rahmen. Mit der Beschreibung von Ansätzen wie dem Design Thinking oder dem Feature-Driven Development werden auch die Verknüpfungen zu den anderen Aufgaben der Softwareentwicklung hergestellt.},

We will delve into the different types of consistency patterns, including strong consistency, weak consistency, and eventual consistency, providing an in-depth explanation and comparison of each. We will also discuss the trade-offs associated with each consistency pattern and how they can impact system performance. Furthermore, we will cover real-world use cases of consistency patterns, illustrating how they are applied in different scenarios. Finally, we will outline the best practices for implementing consistency patterns and highlight the common anti-patterns to avoid. This post will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of consistency patterns in distributed systems, helping you make informed decisions when designing and implementing your own distributed systems.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence ({AI}) offers organizations much potential. Considering the manifold application areas, {AI}’s inherent complexity, and new organizational necessities, companies encounter pitfalls when adopting {AI}. An informed decision regarding an organization’s readiness increases the probability of successful {AI} adoption and is important to successfully leverage {AI}’s business value. Thus, companies need to assess whether their assets, capabilities, and commitment are ready for the individual {AI} adoption purpose. Research on {AI} readiness and {AI} adoption is still in its infancy. Consequently, researchers and practitioners lack guidance on the adoption of {AI}. The paper presents five categories of {AI} readiness factors and their illustrative actionable indicators. The {AI} readiness factors are deduced from an in-depth interview study with 25 {AI} experts and triangulated with both scientific and practitioner literature. Thus, the paper provides a sound set of organizational {AI} readiness factors, derives corresponding indicators for {AI} readiness assessments, and discusses the general implications for {AI} adoption. This is a first step toward conceptualizing relevant organizational {AI} readiness factors and guiding purposeful decisions in the entire {AI} adoption process for both research and practice.},

	abstract = {Research in artificial intelligence ({AI}) is heavily shaped by big tech today. In the {US} context, companies such as Google and Microsoft profit from a tremendous position of power due to their control over cloud computing, large data sets and {AI} talent. In light of this dominance, many media researchers and activists demand open infrastructures and community-led approaches to provide alternative perspectives – however, it is exactly this discourse that companies are appropriating for their expansion strategies. In recent years, big tech has taken up the narrative of democratizing {AI} by open-sourcing their machine learning ({ML}) tools, simplifying and automating the application of {AI} and offering free educational {ML} resources. The question that remains is how an alternative approach to {ML} infrastructures – and to the development of {ML} systems – can still be possible. What are the implications of big tech’s strive for infrastructural expansion under the umbrella of ‘democratization’? And what would a true democratization of {ML} entail? I will trace these two questions by critically examining, first, the open-source discourse advanced by big tech, as well as, second, the discourse around the {AI} open-source community Hugging Face that sees {AI} ethics and democratization at the heart of their endeavour. Lastly, I will show how {ML} algorithms need to be considered beyond their instrumental notion. It is thus not enough to simply hand over the technology to the community – we need to think about how we can conceptualize a radically different approach to the creation of {ML} systems.},

	abstract = {Early analysis of Bitcoin concluded that it did not meet the economic conditions to be classified as a currency. Since this conclusion, interest in Bitcoin has increased substantially. We investigate whether the introduction of futures trading in Bitcoin is able to resolve the issues that stopped Bitcoin from being considered a currency. Our analysis shows that spot volatility has increased following the appearance of futures contracts, that futures contracts are not an effective hedging instrument, and that price discovery is driven by uninformed investors in the spot market. We therefore argue that the conclusion that Bitcoin is a speculative asset rather than a currency is not altered by the introduction of futures trading.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07683},
	abstract = {To understand the impacts of {AI}-driven coding tools on engineers' workflow and work environment, we utilize the Jellyfish platform to analyze indicators of change. Key indicators are derived from Allocations, Coding Fraction vs. {PR} Fraction, Lifecycle Phases, Cycle Time, Jira ticket size, {PR} pickup time, {PR} comments, {PR} comment count, interactions, and coding languages. Significant changes were observed in coding time fractions among Copilot users, with an average decrease of 3\% with individual decreases as large as 15\%. Ticket sizes decreased by an average of 16\% across four companies, accompanied by an 8\% decrease in cycle times, whereas the control group showed no change. Additionally, the {PR} process evolved with Copilot usage, featuring longer and more comprehensive comments, despite the weekly number of {PRs} reviewed remaining constant. Not all hypothesized changes were observed across all participating companies. However, some companies experienced a decrease in {PR} pickup times by up to 33\%, indicating reduced workflow bottlenecks, and one company experienced a shift of up to 17\% of effort from maintenance and support work towards product growth initiatives. This study is the first to utilize data from more than one company and goes beyond simple productivity and satisfaction measures, considering real-world engineering settings instead. By doing so, we highlight that some companies seem to benefit more than others from the use of Copilot and that changes can be subtle when investigating aggregates rather than specific aspects of engineering work and workflows - something that will be further investigated in the future.},
