Here are the most important principles:

# 1. KISS - Keep it simple, stupid!
- Always create clean, simple code.
- No magic tricks in the code. It's important, that the whole team understand the code
- The simplest solution is most likely the right one
- do not add additional NuGet Packages or concepts without asking your team-leader

**Why do we do that:**
- Overengineering looms everywhere 
- It gone slow us down and gonna cause problems nobody can solve in reasonable time.

# 2. Ensure Flexibility
- code which is easy to understand is easy to change
- having a lot of unit tests will protect you from unwanted side effects
- a good documentation helps always

**Why do we do that:**
- there will be a lot of changes
- we need to make the code base change-ready


# 3. Document the important stuff
- What won't you know in 6 Months about your own code
- Always ask yourself: What does the customer needs to know?
- challenge the Project Manager about what we've got to document

**Why do we do that:**
- we need to have a well documented system
- the contract defines a lot of documentations, ask your PM

# 4. The art of saying no
- do not let the customer push you into new requirements without having a change request
- do not accept tasks without having a good understanding of what to do
- time pressure is no reason to code "scrappy"

**Why do we do that:**
- there will be harsh times in the project
- prepare yourself to say NO to the PL or customer


# 5. Sharing is caring
- keep the team up dap date about your tasks
- if you made an important decision, let the team know (document it)
- if you added a new principle or Nuget, let the team know (document it)

**Why do we do that:**
- we are big team in a long running project
- without information sharing we will be lost
